# Underwater_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Machine_Learning_Techniques
With the increasing underwater applications, underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) have 
become crucial. Routing protocols used to keep network connectivity and reliable transmission are 
essential in UWSNs. Efficient energy consumption and reliable data transmission are critical challenges 
in Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) due to the harsh underwater environment and 
limited energy resources. In existing study, the Energy-Efficient Guiding-Network-Based Routing 
(EEGNBR) uses multi-hop method for data transmission which leads to high energy consumption. In 
proposed method, the sensors are segregated into clusters where every cluster has a cluster-head whose 
job is to collect and transmit data. Selection of cluster-head can be done by using Machine Learning 
based Cluster Head Selection Method (ML-CHSM). This cluster-head selection method minimizes the 
energy consumption and improves the network lifetime. The machine learning-based cluster head 
selection method aims to optimize energy consumption, prolonging the network's operational lifetime, 
and improves data transmission reliability. In this project, the usage of machine learning techniques is 
proposed to enhance energy efficiency and optimize data transmission in UWSNs. Through 
simulations, the effectiveness of overall efficiency and reliability of data transmission is shown in
UWSNs
